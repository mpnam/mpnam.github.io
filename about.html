## About

I am a Ph.D. student at JAIST and a software engineering at VMobile and Vietec Corp.
Besides research, I love programming (C#, Java, Ocaml, Javascript, PHP). My favourite languages are C# and Javascript.
I also play guitar and photography in my free time.

Recently, I and my friends have just launched an open source project named `jaist-mobile`. Its purpose is to improve the mobile experience of students who study in Jaist.

Support the repo by starring or forking it! Especically if you are living in Jaist :-)
